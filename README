= dm-fixture

A rip of some of ActiveRecord's fixtures helpers, ported to DataMapper. For the conservative/slow adopters of dm-sweatshop.

== Install & Run

 # Gemfile
 # Put dm-fixture in dev + test to make its rake tasks available by default - only in :test is not available at the command line
 group :development, :test do
   gem 'dm-fixture', :path => '../dm-fixture', :require => 'dm-fixture'
 end

 # This will load all the fixtures via test:prepare and run all tests
 $ RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake test

 # In addition, this will run only unit tests and show backtraces
 $ RAILS_ENV=test BACKTRACE=yes bundle exec rake test:units

== Contributing to dm-fixture
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.

== Support

This is open source, so feel free to branch. Admittedly, this does not fix the issue of updating the authoritative repo/official gem. So, I commit to maintaining this branch, and if I no longer am able to, or want to do that, I'll transfer responsibility - just shoot me an e-mail.
